- 👋 Hi, I’m @rmatarrita
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms and data structures, systems design and architecture, programming languages and operating systems, agile methodologies and high performance team leadership.
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing coding in C++ and JavaScript, as I am a hand-off coding manager, but I like keeping my coding skills sharpened. I chose C++ because it's a foundational programming language that allows you to do an extensive varied type of work, and JavaScript because of its pervasive presence in the Web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on management and leadership coaching 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
