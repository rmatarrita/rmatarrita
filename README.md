- 👋 Hi, I’m @rmatarrita. I worked as a software engineer mostly in C#, C++ and T-SQL from 2003 to 20013. Then I took on the leadership career path for frontend and full stack developers. 
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms and data structures, systems design and architecture, programming languages and operating systems, agile methodologies and high performance team leadership.
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing coding in C++ and JavaScript, as I am a hands-off-coding manager, but I like keeping my coding skills sharpened. I chose C++ because it's a foundational programming language that allows you to do an extensive varied type of work, and JavaScript because of its pervasive presence in the Web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on management and leadership coaching 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
